## Bugs and Fixes

-   ### Bug

1. Issue with height on the element with class "container-about-content", where its child element was overflowing.
    As result, the background-color applied did not cover the child element.

2. Issue with the width of the cards on Cottages page because of inline styling which came with bootstrap code.

3. Issue with social links on the Home page. On mobile view, icons align on the left and did not look the same as on larger screens.

4. Issue with an image on the cards of the Cottages page. The image is stretched when viewed on iPhone 5SE.

5. When testing, found an issue with the form on Book Now page. When filling the form, the user has to choose both cottages, in order to submit the form.
This is due to having a required attribute to both of the input elements. The issue will be resolved in future updates due to time constraints.

-   ### Fix

1.  Add the code:
        
         html{
             height: 100%;
        } 

        body {
            min-height: 100vh;
        }

        .container-about-content {
            min-height: 50vh;
        }

2.  Remove the inline styling and add a custom one.        

3. Fixed issue by positioning the icons at the bottom center of the page instead of left. To achieve this added properties to the parent element
     and amended the properties of the child element.

4. Fix issue by removing "_margin: 0 auto;_" from class **_card-row_** and add "_margin-left and margin-right -10px_" to the same class and to the 
    **_cottages-heading-container_**, also reduce the padding of **_cottages-container_** from 15px to 10px. 
    Also add media qiery for xs devices and change the "_height_" of the class **_card-cottages_** form 650px to 600px.
    Please note that the orientation of the images on the cards is **Portrait**, not **Landscape**! 
## Testing
### W3C Validator Testing

The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were
no syntax errors in the project.

[W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

-   No errors found [View results here](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fsteff880.github.io%2FMS2-project-Cozy-Cottage%2F)

[W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

- One error found - Property backdrop-filter doesn't exist : blur(14px);. I used this property to add a blurred effect on the cards behind the text. Used in Cottages page. Could not find a way around it.
- Warnings are either from vendor prefixes or bootstrap.

### [JSHint](https://jshint.com/)

-  Testing home.js: 

    - Result - One warning for _const_ 

-   Testing cottages.js:

    - Result - Eight warnings for _let_

-   Testing book-now.js:

    - Result - Seven warnings for _let_

-   Testing contact.js:

    - Result - Ten warnings for using _const_ and _let_
    
    - **Please note that the code for text animation has few global variables. Code was taken from an external resource and done exactly as shown on the [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUEB9FogoP8), in order to keep functionality and only names of the variables are changed to fit project needs.**

    <tr>
        <td>End date</td>
        <td>Be able to choose end date</td>
        <td>Pass</td>
    </tr>
</table>

- **Please note that when tested _Choose start date_ and _Choose end date_ input fields, found that you are able to submit even when choosing a start date to be later than the end date. This will be corrected in future updates. Maybe it would have been better instead of having to choose the start date and end date,
    just to choose a start date. As there is an input field for how many nights the user will stay.**
